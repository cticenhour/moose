# ControllableInputTimes

!syntax description /Times/ControllableInputTimes

This object should be used to specify a time sequence dynamically updating during the simulation.


`ControllableInputTimes` supports two inputs: a controllable real-valued `next_time` and a non-controllable time sequences input `times`. If both are provided, theyâ€™re merged and kept in sorted order to form a single schedule.

In the example, `RealFunctionControl` computes the next event time during the run and updates `ControllableInputTimes` accordingly. You can predefine fixed event times with `times`, and adjust [!param](/Times/ControllableInputTimes/next_time) on the fly via the control block.

!alert note
The controllable times are added to / sorted into the times vector and are never removed, even when the value of the controllable [!param](/Times/ControllableInputTimes/next_time) parameter is changed.
