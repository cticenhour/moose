# GeometricSearchData

- Sometimes information needs to be exchanged between disconnected pieces of mesh.
- Examples include:
    - Mechanical Contact
    - Gap Heat Conduction
    - Radiation
    - Constraints
    - Mesh Tying
- The Geometric Search system allows an application to track evolving geometric relationships.
- Currently, this entails two main capabilities: [`NearestNodeLocator`](/NearestNodeLocator.md) and [`PenetrationLocator`](/PenetrationLocator.md).
- The `PenetrationLocator` capability defaults to a quick, mesh-topology-based location algorithm. cases where a node may touch a surface element that does not incorporate it, such as Flex IGA meshes and adaptively-refined 3D meshes, should `setSearchUsingPointLocator(true)` to switch to a more thorough octree-based algorithm.
- Most user interaction with GeometricSearchData is likely to be through objects which inherit from `GeometricSearchInterface`.  Users can change the algorithm of PenetrationLocator by setting `search_using_point_locator=true` on such objects.
- Both of the capabilities work in parallel and with both distributed and replicated meshes.
- Locators can be requested using four different methods on the `GeometricSearchData` API:
    - `getQuadraturePenetrationLocator`
    - `getPenetrationLocator`
    - `getQuadratureNearestNodeLocator`
    - `getNearestNodeLocator`
- The `*Quadrature*` based methods should be used within quadrature-point based objects like:
    - [`Materials`](Materials/index.md) e.g. the `HeatConduction` module's `GapConductance` object
    - [`IntegratedBCs`](syntax/BCs/index.md) e.g. the `HeatConduction` module's `GapHeatTransfer` object
    - [Elemental `AuxKernels`](AuxKernels/index.md) e.g. the elemental versions of [`GapValueAux`](/GapValueAux.md), [`NearestNodeDistanceAux`](/NearestNodeDistanceAux.md), and [`PenetrationAux`](/PenetrationAux.md)
- The non-quadrature based methods should be used for nodal objects such as:
    - [`NodeFaceConstraints`](Constraints/index.md) e.g. the `Contact` module's `MechanicalContactConstraint` object
    - [Nodal `AuxKernels`](AuxKernels/index.md) e.g. the nodal versions of [`GapValueAux`](/GapValueAux.md), [`NearestNodeDistanceAux`](/NearestNodeDistanceAux.md), and [`PenetrationAux`](/PenetrationAux.md)
- geometric search objects like [`NearestNodeLocator`](/NearestNodeLocator.md) and [`PenetrationLocator`](/PenetrationLocator.md) should hold to their geometric purpose and +not+ call algebraic APIs like `FEProblemBase::prepare` which will query `libMesh::DofObject` information. This information may or may not have been initialized at the time that geometric search objects are being updated, so any query attempt may result in failed assertions or segmentation faults.
