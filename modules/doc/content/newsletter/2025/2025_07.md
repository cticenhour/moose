## MOOSE Improvements

## Convergence objects may now be used for steady-state detection

The [Convergence system](syntax/Convergence/index.md) may now be used for steady-state
detection in [Transient.md]. Use the `steady_state_convergence` parameter in the
`Executioner` block to specify the name of a `Convergence` object to use. If
not specified, a [DefaultSteadyStateConvergence.md] is created internally
using the existing steady-state detection parameters in the `Executioner`.

## Convergence objects may now be used for MultiApp fixed point solves

The [Convergence system](syntax/Convergence/index.md) may now be used for termination
of MultiApp fixed point solves. Use the `multiapp_fixed_point_convergence` parameter
in the `Executioner` block to specify the name of a `Convergence` object to use. If
not specified, a [DefaultMultiAppFixedPointConvergence.md] is created internally
using the existing fixed point parameters in the `Executioner`.

Also, a new `execute_on` flag was added for the purpose of executing objects
for the purpose of these convergence checks: `MULTIAPP_FIXED_POINT_CONVERGENCE`,
which occurs in each iteration of the MultiApp fixed point loop, immediately prior
to the MultiApp fixed point convergence check, after `TIMESTEP_END` and MultiApps/transfers
executing on `TIMESTEP_END`.

## Added on-the-fly option to the Residual post-processor

To support the new fixed point convergence checks capability, a new option was added
for the `residual_type` parameter in [/Residual.md]: `COMPUTE`, which recomputes
the residual at the time of the post-processor's execution.

## HTML-style comments no longer allowed in MooseDocs

After being informally deprecated [for several years](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/blame/e82beba543d0047b0777b6f322a16cfa69a50ec9/python/MooseDocs/extensions/comment.py#L36),
HTML-style block comments have been removed from MooseDocs. The currently-supported markdown
alternatives for inline and block comments are shown below. For more detailed information about the Comment extension, checkout out [the documentation page](extensions/comment.md).

## MOOSE Modules Changes

### Thermal Hydraulics Module

- [HeatTransferFromHeatStructure1Phase.md] now allows the user to specify a subset
  of a heat structure boundary using `hs_boundary` instead of requiring the entire
  heat structure boundary, allowing axial sections to have different coupling.
