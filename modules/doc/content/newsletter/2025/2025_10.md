## MOOSE Improvements

## MOOSE Modules Changes

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2025.10.21` Update

- Fix for `make distclean`
- Fixes for `get_diagonal()` and `get_transpose()` in `EigenSparseMatrix`, and implementations in `LaspackMatrix`
- Improved test coverage for sparse matrix transposes and norms
- `DofObject` and `Elem` invalid id constants are now `constexpr`, for improved CPU performance and GPGPU compatibility
- `VariationalMeshSmoother` now supports prism elements; additionally, the verbosity and tolerances of the variational system solve are now user-controllable
- Fix a potential preallocation error in parallel HDF5 sparse matrix reads
- Fixes for poly2tri headers
- Drop deprecated public `Mesh::boundary_info` member
- Add tests for higher order quads in the variational smoother
- Add tests for mixed elements in the variational smoother
- Add fix for `MeshTools::find_nodal_neighbors` to work with higher order elements
- Update `BoundaryInfo` to enable ID removal and renumbering one boundary at a time
- Optimize Lagrange shape computations in 1D
