## MOOSE Modules Changes

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2025.10.21` Update

- Dropped deprecated public `Mesh::boundary_info` member.  Other
  long-deprecated APIs are now dropped in libMesh `master` and will be
  removed in the next submodule update!
- Added `BoundaryInfo` methods to enable ID removal and/or renumbering one boundary at a time
- `VariationalMeshSmoother` now supports prism elements; additionally, the verbosity and tolerances of the variational system solve are now user-controllable
- Fix for `MeshTools::find_nodal_neighbors` to work with higher order elements
- Fixes for `get_diagonal()` and `get_transpose()` in `EigenSparseMatrix`, and implementations in `LaspackMatrix`
- `DofObject` and `Elem` invalid id constants are now `constexpr`, for improved CPU performance and GPGPU compatibility
- Fix for a potential preallocation error in parallel HDF5 sparse matrix reads
- Fixes for poly2tri headers
- More optimization for Lagrange 1D shape computations, including in
  tensor product (e.g. quad, hex, prism) calculations
- Test coverage for higher order quads and for mixed elements in the variational smoother
- Improved test coverage for sparse matrix transposes and norms
