## MOOSE Improvements

### Test change reports on pull requests

CIVET now automatically generates testing reports on pull requests which notably indicate:

- which tests were added by the pull request
- which tests were removed by the pull request
- any significant change in runtime by the existing tests

### MFEM Backend improvements

- Fixed an issue where time step information in the console output lagged by one time step
- Added the ability to compile MFEM with the full range of supported build methods: oprof, devel, dbg, and opt
- Improved support for selecting/validating basis functions for different FE spaces
- Fixed the attributes inherited by boundary submeshes from the parent mesh
- Workaround for breaking changes in hypre 3.0 to PCG/GMRES relating to preconditioning matrix reuse
- Performance and documentation improvements
- Added the ability to define cut transition submeshes, e.g., to model an induced electromotive force on a closed loop
- Added an auxiliary kernel to sum an arbitrary number of variables
- Added two mixed form kernels akin to the diffusion and vector mass kernels, for when test and trial variables may differ
- Added the ability to set an initial condition on a scalar variable on a boundary
- Added a postprocessor to integrate the dot product of two vector variables over a given domain

## MOOSE Modules Changes

### Navier Stokes module

The Physics syntax in the Navier Stokes module can now create the energy conservation equation using a specific enthalpy variable instead
of a temperature variable. This was implemented to facilitate code coupling and the future study of phase changes.

### Subchannel module

Subchannel simulations can now be run in serial within a simulation with multiple processes. This enables using a SCM solve as the parent
application along with child(ren) `MultiApps` that are ran in parallel.

The interwrapper problems for quadrilateral and triangular lattice geometries were removed. This is part of simplification and abstraction effort
which will facilitate the maintenance and development of capabilities in SCM.

### Solid mechanics module

The [ElementJacobianDamper.md] can now operate on elements that have become so distorted that the Jacobian of the mapping is negative.
The loop on dampers will now catch the exception caused by a negative Jacobian, and MOOSE will re-try the solve with a smaller time step.

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2025.10.21` Update

- Dropped deprecated public `Mesh::boundary_info` member.  Other
  long-deprecated APIs are now dropped in libMesh `master` and will be
  removed in the next submodule update!
- Added `BoundaryInfo` methods to enable ID removal and/or renumbering one boundary at a time
- `VariationalMeshSmoother` now supports prism elements; additionally, the verbosity and tolerances of the variational system solve are now user-controllable
- Fix for `MeshTools::find_nodal_neighbors` to work with higher order elements
- Fixes for `get_diagonal()` and `get_transpose()` in `EigenSparseMatrix`, and implementations in `LaspackMatrix`
- `DofObject` and `Elem` invalid id constants are now `constexpr`, for improved CPU performance and GPGPU compatibility
- Fix for a potential preallocation error in parallel HDF5 sparse matrix reads
- Fixes for poly2tri headers
- More optimization for Lagrange 1D shape computations, including in
  tensor product (e.g. quad, hex, prism) calculations
- Test coverage for higher order quads and for mixed elements in the variational smoother
- Improved test coverage for sparse matrix transposes and norms

## PETSc-level Changes

## Bug Fixes, Minor Changes, and Minor Enhancements

- Invalid IDs are now excluded when generating a positions list with [ElementGroupCentroidPositions.md]
- An example was added for activating objects for single time step using [chain controls](syntax/ChainControls/index.md).
- The `outputs=none` parameter, on a per-object basis, is now obeyed more closely when the `show` parameter, in the `Outputs` block, is used.
- The [ADScaledCoupledTimeDerivative.md] kernel was added to the framework to handle the common case of needing to scale a time derivative of a coupled variable.
- The [ParsedAux.md] now uses face arguments for functors when restricted to one or more boundaries
