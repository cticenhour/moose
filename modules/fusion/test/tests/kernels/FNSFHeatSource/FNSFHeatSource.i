# This test uses the custom kernel "FNSFHeatSource" to project a temperature on an outboard fusion blanket. The test projects a vlaue of 1 on the first half of the fusion blanket near the
# first wall and a value of 2 near the back wall. The results where visually confirmed in paraview and used as a gold file for testing. There is also a manufactured solution for this test
# with a mms.i input file that uses the custom kernal.
