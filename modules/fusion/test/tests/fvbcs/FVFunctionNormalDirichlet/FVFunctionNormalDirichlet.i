# This test uses a cutsom boundary condition "FVFunctionNormalDirichlet" on a 1D line. This custom object is intended to be used for the porous flow model
# along the navier stokes module and provides a boundary condtion for the normal. The results of this case was visually checked in paraview and used as a gold 
# file for testing.
