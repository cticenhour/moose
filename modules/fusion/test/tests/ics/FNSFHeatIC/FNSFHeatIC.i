# This test uses the custom initial condition "FNSFHeatIC" which projects an initial condition onto the outboard fusion blanket. This test projects an intial
# condtion of 1 on half of the blanket near the frist wall and a initial condition of 2 alongside the back wall. The results where visually confirmed in paraview
# and used as a gold fild for testing.
