abstract = {The SubChannel Module, referred to as SCM henceforward in this document, is a subchannel code within the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) developed at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). SCM, is able to model flow through liquid-metal cooled, wire-wrapped fuel pin sub-assemblies, ordered in a triangular lattice. This work extends the existing validation done for these flow types and geometries and introduces validation for the newly implemented capability to model flows within a deformed duct. The subchannel duct deformation modeling approach consisted of reproducing the deformed duct effect on the geometric parameters of the boundary subchannels, i.e., modifying surface area, wetted perimeter and pin to duct gap. Then, the model was validated using experimental data taken from Areva’s fuel cooling test facility (FCTF).}
