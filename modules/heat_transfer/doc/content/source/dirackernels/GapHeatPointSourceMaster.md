!syntax description /DiracKernels/GapHeatPointSourceMaster

The [PenetrationLocator.md] is used to find the points of contact between the primary boundary
(specified with the [!param](/DiracKernels/GapHeatPointSourceMaster/boundary)) and the secondary boundary.
A heat source is then applied using the local value of the secondary heat flux.
